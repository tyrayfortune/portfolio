            <p >Web developer with a passion for learning. Experience with JavaScript, Python, and Java coupled with a
            background in the Armed Forces. I have gained a diverse and useful skillset focusing on quality, time management, and technical 
            learning. I fell in love with web development as it felt like a never-ending puzzle that always kept my mind engaged.
            With my background in leadership and team-based roles I am eager to contribute my technical skills and have an impact 
            on software teams. Also I love gaming and can hold my breath for over two minutes.
